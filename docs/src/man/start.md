## Usage

The basic usage is demonstrated with the [US industrial production index (IPI)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IPB50001SQ) provided by FRED data service.

```Julia
using TrendDecomposition
using CSV

# Set path to directory where time series is located
path = "/.../data"

IPI = CSV.read("$(path)/IPB50001SQ.csv", copycols=true)

# HP filter with λ = 1600
hp = HP(IPI[!, 2], 1600)

# The above is equivalent to Whittaker-Henderson smoothing with m = 2 differentiation
wh = bohl_filter(IPI[!, 2], 2, 1600)

# Boosted HP filter with baysian-type information criterion (BIC)
bHP_bic = bHP(IPI[!, 2], 1600, Criterion="BIC")

# Boosted HP filter with augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test 
bHP_adf = bHP(IPI[!, 2], 1600, Criterion="ADF", p=0.01)
```
